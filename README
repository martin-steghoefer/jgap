About this Release:

This represents an alpha release of JGAP, the Java Genetic Algorithms
Package. Since it's an alpha release, it's not feature complete and
probably contains bugs. The APIs are also considered a work in progress
and are subject to change.

Any existing documentation, including Javadocs, can be found on the JGAP
home page at http://jgap.sourceforge.net. Javadocs can also be found in
the javadocs/ directory of the JGAP distribution. A basic introduction to
the contents of the JGAP package is also provided in this file, below.

Please direct any questions, comments, problems, or inquiries to the
JGAP development mailing list at jgap-devl@lists.sourceforge.net

Thanks for trying out JGAP!

Brief Introduction to Working with JGAP:

JGAP is a Java package that provides basic genetic algorithms
functionality. As this version is a pre-alpha, it's not feature complete
and probably contains bugs. However, basic functionality is present and
has been found to serve adequately for the needs of the authors.

To use JGAP in a particular application, you need to write a class that
implements the org.jgap.FitnessFunction interface. Implementations of
this interface are used during the natural selection process to
determine each Chromosome's fitness for survival. Since this function is
completely dependent on the problem you're trying to solve, it's up to
you to provide an implementation of it. For an example of a fitness
function, see the MaxFunction class in the examples/ directory. That
particular function treats the bits in a Chromosome as a binary number
and returns their corresponding numeric value as the fitness function of
the Chromosome (thereby assigning a higher fitness value to Chromosomes
whose bits happen to represent a larger binary number).

If desired, you can also provide your own implementation of the
org.jgap.NaturalSelector interface, but this usually isn't necessary as
the WeightedRouletteSelector implementation that is included with JGAP
should be sufficient for most needs. The NaturalSelector is
responsible for actually choosing a subset of a population that will
"survive" and move on to the next round of evolution. Typically,
chromosomes are selected based on their fitness value (as determined by
the FitnessFunction implementation), although it's generally
considered good practice to consider this value only a statistical
chance of survival, and not a guaranteed chance.

Once you've implemented your fitness function and, optionally, your
natural selector, you just need to build a population of Chromosomes
(a Genotype) and start evolving them. The easiest way to do that is to
take advantage of the Genotype.randomInitialGenotype() static method.
You simply need to specify the desired size of the population of
Chromosomes, the number of genes (bits) in each Chromosome, an instance
of the desired fitness function, and, optionally, a statistical mutation
rate. The method will create a Genotype for you with a randomly
generated population according to your specifications. If you prefer,
you can also manually construct the Genotype yourself, passing it an
array of Chromosomes that you have previously created yourself (the
Chromosome class also has a randomInitialChromosome() method to make
generation of Chromosomes easier, if desired).

After you've created an instance of a Genotype, you simply invoke its
evolve() method as many times as desired. With each invocation, the
population of Chromosomes goes through the process of evolution and
natural selection. The getChromosomes() method can be used to retrieve
the population, or you can use the getFittestChromosome() method to
retrieve the Chromosome with the highest fitness value.

For a simple example of a program that makes use of the JGAP package,
see the TestGenetics class in the examples/ directory. It creates a
Genotype using the randomInitialGenotype() method, evolves it a number
of times specified as a command-line argument to the program, and then
writes the resulting population of Chromosomes in human- readable format
to standard out, along with the Chromosome possessing the highest
fitness value.

For more details on all of the above, you are highly encouraged to read
through the Javadocs found in the javadocs/ directory. There are a very
limited number of classes in the package, and the documentation attempts
to be simple and straight-forward. Other documentation may be found at
the JGAP home page at http://jgap.sourceforge.net
